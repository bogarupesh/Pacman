Description
This Pac-Man game implementation features a game board, Pac-Man character, and four ghosts. Players control Pac-Man's movement using arrow keys, guiding him to eat pellets while avoiding contact with ghosts. Eating power pellets enables Pac-Man to temporarily turn the tables and eat ghosts. The game ends when Pac-Man either successfully clears the maze of pellets or loses all lives by colliding with ghosts.
